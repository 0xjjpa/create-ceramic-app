# Create Ceramic App Templates
This folder contains the templates that Create Ceramic App officially supports.

## Template Guidelines
In order to ensure that templates require minimal research and learning we will only accept templates that adhere to the following rules.
1. Avoid using external packages that are not provided/developed by the Ceramic Network team. Examples include: Redux, Apollo, MobX.
2. Exceptions may be made if the template is solely focused on using a single package with Ceramic. For example a template only using Relay would be permitted, however if the template uses Relay and Redux it would not be accepted.
